<h1>Information</h1>

<p>Have you ever noticed that your diffuser liquid stops decreasing and the scent no longer spreads? The sticks (reed sticks) used in diffusers have a lifespan. It is generally recommended to replace them once a month.</p>

<p>The DiffuserStick app lets you record the date when you inserted the diffuser sticks along with a photo. When it’s time to replace them, you will receive a push notification reminder.</p>

<h1>How to Use</h1>
<ul>
<li>List Tab: Tap the [+] button at the top right to add a diffuser. Use the button at the top left to sort the list. Added diffusers will appear in the list.</li>
<li>Archive Tab: Diffusers you no longer use can be stored using the [Archive] feature.</li>
<li>Default Period: The default replacement cycle is set to 30 days. You can change it in 15-day increments.</li>
<li>Add Diffuser: Set the title, photo (permission required), memo, and installation date. When the replacement period is reached, a push notification (permission required) will notify you.</li>
